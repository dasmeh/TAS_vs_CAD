Project Summary

Importance
Recent research highlights a significant genetic component in calcified aortic valve stenosis (AS), with overlapping prevalence between AS and coronary artery disease (CAD), another polygenic condition. However, it's unclear which genetic and cardiovascular risk factors are specific to AS or shared with CAD. Additionally, the tissues and cell types through which genetic factors mediate AS risk remain unknown.

Objective
To determine whether the genetic architectures of AS and CAD are independent and to identify the tissues and cell types involved in AS development.

Design, Setting, and Participants
This study presents the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for AS, involving 18,792 AS cases and 434,249 controls. For the first time, the analysis adjusts for comorbid CAD, and replication was performed in two external cohorts. The data were further utilized for genetic correlation, Mendelian randomization (MR), and transcriptome enrichment analyses in AS-relevant tissues and cell types.

Key Results
- Identified 13 genetic risk loci for AS, including 5 novel loci that were externally replicated.
- 11 of the 17 total loci identified were AS-specific and not related to CAD.
- Genetic correlation between AS and CAD was modest (15%).
- MR analysis revealed that higher serum phosphate is an AS-specific risk factor, while blood pressure, BMI, and cholesterol have smaller effects on AS compared to CAD.
- Enrichment analyses emphasize the involvement of valvular endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and tissue-resident macrophages in AS development.

Conclusion
This is the first GWAS study of AS adjusted for CAD, revealing distinct genetic architectures and providing insights into the tissues and cell types involved in AS progression.

Bioinformatics Analyses
We performed a meta-analysis of AS adjusted for CAD using data from 8 European AS GWAS studies, incorporating 12,481,363 autosomal single nucleotide variants (SNVs). 
Genomic control correction was applied, and a fixed-effects variance-weighting model was used for the analysis. We identified 6 novel AS loci and replicated these findings in independent cohorts. 
Genetic correlation was assessed through LD score regression, comparing AS with CAD and other cardiovascular traits. Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to explore causal relationships, using genome-wide significant SNVs as genetic instruments.
For tissue enrichment, we selected 17 tissues from GTEx v8 linked to AS risk processes and performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to identify tissue-specific genes associated with AS. 
Enrichment was further tested using partitioned heritability analyses of GWAS data.
